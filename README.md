# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description

This is demo project from Monnai that portrays an onboarding flow for lending usecase for a "non-traditional employment/gig worker" category using Sahamati.

When prompted for an input phone number

- 9876543210 represents an individual who is
  - working as a Driver in Ola/Uber
  - ready to consent to provide a access to a good amount of his data
- <any other number> represnts an indivisual who is
  - working as a delivery partner
  - not ready to provide consents to various data sources

For demo purposes, enter any data in input fields whereever necessary.

Currently a _Member Token_ needs to be generated for making calls to Sahamati and secrets are not shared in the application for security reasons, but the pages will be rendered for demo purpose.
